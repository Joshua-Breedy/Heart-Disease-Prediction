# Heart-Disease-Prediction
First public machine learning project using Python3 and a KNN model.

Using a public dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the model will predict if a patient is at risk for heart disease. The initial version has an accuracy rate of 55% to 70%, with plans to improve the model and data points over time. 

Uses code snippets from
